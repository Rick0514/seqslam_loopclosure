## SeqSlam experiment 

* demo.py is from seqslam src code, which is suitable for nordland dataset
* I change a lot in seqslam.py, which now support loop closure detection

* run the loop_closure_demo.py and visualize.py you will find figures and animation showing how it works

* model details available at [myblog](https://blog.csdn.net/gy_Rick/article/details/111560335)
